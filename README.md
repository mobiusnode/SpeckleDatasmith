# SpeckleDatasmith

- Was unable to add reference to Engine/Binaries/Win64/DatasmithFacadeCSharp/DatasmithFacadeCSharp.dll. Instead added the .cs files (Engine/Source/Programs/Enterprise/Datasmith/DatasmithFacadeCSharp/Public) to the project. This issue needs to get resolved at some point.

- Datasmith SDK is in c++. Swig is then used to generate .dll and .cs files.
